# Clicky Game

## Overview
  Objective of the game is click on each tile of a fictional once and not to click on that same character again until you click through all the tiles. Everytime you click a character, you score a point. But if you click on the same character twice the game is over and you lose. After every click of a specific tile, all the tiles shuffle, making it harder to remember which tile character you clicked before.
